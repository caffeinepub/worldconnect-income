Implement client-side validation that calculates maxWithdrawal = balance * 0.01 and prevents form submission when entered amount exceeds this limit. Show error message indicating the exact maximum amount allowed (formatted as INR) when validation fails. Use the existing useGetCallerUserProfile hook to access current balance and integrate with existing form validation logic."
